# Property Booking System - Database Schema

This project defines the SQL schema for a simple property booking system. It includes tables for users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging — all interconnected using UUID-based primary and foreign keys.

## 📦 Entities Included
- `users` — system users (guests, hosts, admins)
- `properties` — properties listed by hosts
- `bookings` — reservations made by users
- `payments` — payments for bookings
- `reviews` — user reviews on properties
- `messages` — user-to-user messages

## 🧩 Features
- Uses `UUID` for secure and globally unique IDs
- Fully normalized (up to 3NF)
- Includes constraints and indexes for performance
- Clean, modular SQL structure

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements
- PostgreSQL installed
- Enable the `uuid-ossp` extension in PostgreSQL

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone
