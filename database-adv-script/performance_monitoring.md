1. Create Proper Indexes
Use indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

Composite indexes can speed up multi-column filters.

2. Optimize Queries
Avoid SELECT *; only select the columns you need.

Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand and improve slow queries.

Add WHERE clauses to reduce scanned rows.

3. Partition Large Tables
Use partitioning (e.g., by date) to divide large tables into manageable pieces.

This allows the database engine to only search relevant partitions.

4. Regularly Monitor and Tune Performance
Analyze slow query logs.

Use tools like mysqltuner or performance dashboards.

Periodically update statistics and rebuild indexes if needed.
